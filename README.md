Q1. PART 1: Here we use a "if-else" condition to determine the lenght of the input string. The function in here is to delete 2 characters from the given string, reverse it and print it. Instead of using the del command, we used "input_string[:-2]" to remove the last 2 characters from the given string if else condition is met.
    PART 2: Here we performed 4 arithmetic operations on 2 input numbers. Since the input can have a possible decimals we used float type for input numbers.

Q2. Here we used "replace" method to change any given word in the sentence to a different one in the entire sentence. We replaced python to pythons.

Q3. Here we are using the else if condition to know the grade of a person when he falls into the respective score section. As the score can also be a decimal value, we use float type for input.
